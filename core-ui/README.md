# Module Core UI
Contains the UI components for the core module of the application.

Also contains some navigation logic since navigation and UI are so closely related and we do not 
have enough navigational complexity to justify a separate module. In case that changes, we will
use a different package from the rest of the UI components: `org.pointyware.ember.navigation`.
